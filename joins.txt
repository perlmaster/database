
INNER JOIN: Retrieves customers with orders only. For example, you want
to determine the amount ordered by each customer and you only want to see
those who have ordered something

SELECT Customers.*, Orders.*
FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID =
Orders.CustomerID

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEFT OUTER JOIN: Retrieves all customers with or without orders. Order
data for customers without orders appears as NULL values. For example,
you want to determine the amount ordered by each customer and you need to
see who has not ordered anything as well. You can also see the LEFT OUTER
JOIN as a mirror image of the RIGHT OUTER JOIN if you switch the side of
each table.

SELECT Customers.*, Orders.*
FROM Customers LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID =
Orders.CustomerID

------------------------------------------------------------------------

RIGHT OUTER JOIN: Retrieves all orders with or without matching customer
records. Customer data for orders without customers appears as NULL
values. For example, you want to determine if there are any orders in the
data with undefined CustomerID values (say, after a conversion or
something like it). You can also see the RIGHT OUTER JOIN as a mirror
image of the LEFT OUTER JOIN if you switch the side of each table.

SELECT Customers.*, Orders.*
FROM Customers RIGHT OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID =
Orders.CustomerID
