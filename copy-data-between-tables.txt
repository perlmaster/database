
Here is how to copy data from one table to another table with a similar structue

INSERT INTO TestTable (FirstName, LastName)
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person
WHERE EmailPromotion = 2;

-- copy all columns from one table to another existing table
INSERT INTO new_table
SELECT * FROM old_table;

-- Tip: The SELECT INTO statement can also be used to create a new,
-- empty table using the schema of another.
-- Just add a WHERE clause that causes the query to return no data:

SELECT *
INTO newtable
FROM old_table
WHERE 1=0;
